 *  Changes:
 *
 *    0.8.7    o Expanded HAM loading routines to support
 *               HAM3-5, HAM7 and HAM8, too
 *    0.8.8    o Changed lots of variables to be typeproof (and
 *               working) on machines with long!=32bit and so on.
 *             o Removed any GCC dependancies (dynamically allocated
 *               arrays)
 *             o Made it compile with g++ -O6 -Wall -W -Wno-unused
 *               -ansi -pedantic without any moan (C++ proof)
 *             o Changed width alignment to be always a factor
 *               of 16 (word boundaries per plane). This *might*
 *               OTOH break files saved with byte boundaries in
 *               mind, but I think word boundaries are more
 *               correct (since this is the way Amiga hardware
 *               works)
 *             o Supports IFF-RGBN 12bit pictures including
 *               1bit genlock (alpha channel)
 *             o Piece o' IFF-RGB8 24bit picture support added
 *             o Optimized header recognition by avoiding strings
 *             o A lot of the IFF file i/o code rewritten from scratch
 *             o Added support for ILBM-DEST. Untested, since I
 *               do not have such files.
 *             o Now writes CAMG chunks when useful
 *             o Quick hack to support oversized (ignored) chunks.
 *               Only until the new IFF routines are ready.
 *             o Added support for loading of DPaint-IIe pictures
 *               (IFF-PBM or IPBM)
 *             o Now checks palette indices for valid ranges
 *    0.9.0    o Last change was 1998-10-21...
 *             o Ported to gimp-1.2
 *             o Loading gray indexed images <= 8 bpp still fails
 *    0.9.1    o 20010807
 *             o Fixed bug with loading images that have
 *               odd (len & 1 != 0) hunk sizes
 *               (I can't imagine this bug was in the plugin
 *               from the start?!)
 *             o Included threshold. Do not promote to grayscale
 *               with <= 4 indexed gray colors.
 *             o Fixed bug when loading images that were promoted
 *               to grayscale had less than 256 colors (and
 *               became black after loading)
 *               (actually a checker for invalid input was a
 *               bit too.. busy.)
 *             o Bugfix release
 *    0.9.2    o Changed realm from ILBM to IFF
 *    0.9.3    o Lots of undocumented changes, cleanups, and fixes
 *    0.9.4    o Tried to be able to compile without gimp-config available
