 *  Changes:
 *
 *    0.8.7    o Expanded HAM loading routines to support
 *               HAM3-5, HAM7 and HAM8, too
 *    0.8.8    o Changed lots of variables to be typeproof (and
 *               working) on machines with long!=32bit and so on.
 *             o Removed any GCC dependancies (dynamically allocated
 *               arrays)
 *             o Made it compile with g++ -O6 -Wall -W -Wno-unused
 *               -ansi -pedantic without any moan (C++ proof)
 *             o Changed width alignment to be always a factor
 *               of 16 (word boundaries per plane). This *might*
 *               OTOH break files saved with byte boundaries in
 *               mind, but I think word boundaries are more
 *               correct (since this is the way Amiga hardware
 *               works)
 *             o Supports IFF-RGBN 12bit pictures including
 *               1bit genlock (alpha channel)
 *             o Piece o' IFF-RGB8 24bit picture support added
 *             o Optimized header recognition by avoiding strings
 *             o A lot of the IFF file i/o code rewritten from scratch
 *             o Added support for ILBM-DEST. Untested, since I
 *               do not have such files.
 *             o Now writes CAMG chunks when useful
 *             o Quick hack to support oversized (ignored) chunks.
 *               Only until the new IFF routines are ready.
 *             o Added support for loading of DPaint-IIe pictures
 *               (IFF-PBM or IPBM)
 *             o Now checks palette indices for valid ranges
